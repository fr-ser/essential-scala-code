# Notes

- Is it ok to do a map, just to get a value and follow it up with another operation?
    Does the compiler optimize it to avoid looping more often than required?

- *Danger: MicroOptimization*: To get the smallest item in Exc 16a, we use sort with head.
    Is this optimized in the compiler? Can I ignore such things?
